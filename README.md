## Setup
You need to install npm (you can do this by installing Node.js). Once that is done, run npm install in this directory to install all the requirements.

# Usage
First, run node . to start the script.

This is where you will see the confirmation:

reminder: If you add any other dependencies, please do it by running npm install --save <my-dependency> so it is added to package.json for the next person to install. Otherwise, add the package manually to package.json

fact of the day: Use ctrl+c to exit the "node ." triggered example app
